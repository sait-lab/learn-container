## Docker Compose



Excerpt from [Docker Compose overview | Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

> Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications. It is the key to unlocking a streamlined and efficient development and deployment experience.
>
> Compose simplifies the control of your entire application stack, making it easy to manage services, networks, and volumes in a single, comprehensible YAML configuration file. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration file.
>
> Compose works in all environments; production, staging, development, testing, as well as CI workflows. It also has commands for managing the whole lifecycle of your application:
>
> - Start, stop, and rebuild services
> - View the status of running services
> - Stream the log output of running services
> - Run a one-off command on a service
